Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older


We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can go from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can go from this, yeah
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, yeah it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)

Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah

So I call you mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

Fighting flames of fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
Hope
Hope
Hope
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit
Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why
You made me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
Hope
Hope ('cause you had me so low)
Hope (now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Welcome home
How's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name?
I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?
Okay, enough
P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you
To eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will
And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
What the hell?
I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the fuck is Drew from home, anyway?
This vacation
You said going home was boring
Left out that part of the story on your way
I might deserve it
But I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest
My record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone
And I tried my best
Cross my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself
For when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
But I won't be sad for the sake of it (P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)
(P.S. I hope you're)

Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are takin' me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Draw the line, I'm by the line (yeah)

Yeah, I just want to drink tequila with my friends
She said she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense

Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me

And now I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said
And I'm not trying to be like "poor me, " I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just want to drink tequila with my friends
Yeah they're the reason that I still am who I am

You had one job!
Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair wavin' out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah
Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Oh, darling of mine
On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past and
It's that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of thing, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just wanna taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all
Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been? (Where have you been?)
I feel so alive
With you in my bed (You in my bed)
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go (Please don't let go)
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

Oh, darling of mine

I don't really say this that often
But there's something that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them but I know
They're painting but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them But I know,
They wanna see me hang on the wall
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losing, but I'm losing my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
Yeah, if I'm dead, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, If I'm dead, you owe me)
You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me

In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody
You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again
People change with the weather
In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody
Somebody
(You know, just know what I like)
Somebody
In my head I knew better (in my head I knew better)
I won't blame it on my faults again
I know I should forget her
(You know, just know what I like)
I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
In the town full of fancy cars and crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody

Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuitton and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly (oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said)
(You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open (oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said)
(You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' (oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said)
Until it's over (you hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Holdin' even though it kills you slowly (oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said)
(You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)

Dropping bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hits you all at once
I'm already tired and it's the morning
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughing
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darling, I have to cut you off
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
So, don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say you're human
You say you've regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
So, don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say
Don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
So, don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
So, don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say

No way
Don't say you're human
No way, no way you're human
